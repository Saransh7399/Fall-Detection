   - XGBoost  
   - Custom ResNet Models  
   - Decision Trees and Random Forest  
   - One-Class SVM  
   - Gradient Boosting  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Missing value checks  
   - Outlier analysis and thresholding  
   - Feature selection (`x`, `y`, `z`)  
- **Performance Metrics:**  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix Analysis

## 📊 **Dataset**
The dataset includes accelerometer data with the following features:  
| Column | Description |  
|--------|-------------|  
| `x`, `y`, `z` | Accelerometer readings on 3 axes |  
| `010-000-024-033`, `010-000-030-096` | Sensor activation tags |  
| `020-000-032-221`, `020-000-033-111` | Additional binary tags |  
| `anomaly` | Label: `0` (No fall), `1` (Fall) |  

- **Class Distribution:**  
   - Normal instances (`0`): ~95%  
   - Anomalies (`1`): ~5%

## ⚙️ **Steps Performed**
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**  
   - Ensured no missing values.  
   - Analyzed class imbalance and outliers.  
2. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Compared falls and non-falls using t-tests for the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes.  
   - Derived baseline and threshold values for fall detection.  
3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Focused on `x`, `y`, `z` axes based on correlation analysis.  
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**  
   - Trained multiple ML models and evaluated their performance.  
   - Fine-tuned the **Custom ResNet model** to optimize recall and precision.
